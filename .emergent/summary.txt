<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a static HTML/CSS/JS BitSecure crypto trading platform to a React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) stack with MongoDB. Initial work involved understanding the mixed codebase, implementing user authentication (JWT), integrating specific crypto wallet addresses, and setting up a basic transaction system with admin notifications. The development was highly iterative, with the user providing frequent feedback on UI/UX (color schemes, icon aesthetics) and core functionalities (user balance logic, admin panel features, user home page, individual messaging). Significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting authentication and routing issues, demonstrating a methodical approach to debugging both backend ( incompatibility) and frontend (incorrect redirection logic) problems. The engineer was in the process of replacing emojis with elegant icons and updating the color scheme for a more vibrant look, and was also in the middle of updating navigation buttons when the trajectory ended.

<product_requirements>
The user provided an initial problem statement to update crypto reception wallets, host the application, and enable functional transactions with admin notifications.

Key requirements and implemented features:
*   **Wallet Integration**: Replace existing reception wallets with user-provided BTC, ETH, Tether, BNB, and Cardano addresses.
*   **Transaction Functionality**: Implement deposit and withdrawal systems.
*   **Admin Notifications**: Notify the administrator about deposits, withdrawals, and user registrations via an internal dashboard.
*   **Application Hosting**: The application was hosted and made functional (URL: ).
*   **User Balance Logic**: Users should start with €0 balance, not €100. Only the administrator can modify user balances via an admin panel. Deposits must be pending and require admin approval.
*   **Deposit Form Enhancements**:
    *   **Wallet Deposit**: Remove tu dirección de billetera field, keeping only quantity, destination wallet, and a copy button.
    *   **Crypto Voucher Deposit**: Add a quantity field for the user to specify the amount, which is sent to the admin.
*   **User Experience (UX) Improvements**:
    *   **Home Page**: Implement a dedicated home page for logged-in users, accessible via a home button, displaying crypto information, news, trading data, and user-specific values.
    *   **Dashboard Design**: Redesign the non-admin user dashboard to be more decorative, attractive, symmetrical, and less boring, including crypto-related elements, images, and news.
    *   **Trust Information**: Add relevant information inspiring confidence and security to both deposit and withdrawal sections.
*   **Admin Panel Enhancements**:
    *   **Notification Management**: Add a collapse/expand button for notifications to prevent screen clutter.
    *   **Individual Messaging**: Implement a feature for the admin to send individual messages to users.
*   **UI Aesthetics**:
    *   **Color Palette**: Initially requested a harmonious, minimalist, elegant, and legible color palette. Later requested a more lively and cheerful, yet legible, color scheme.
    *   **Iconography**: Replace all ugly emojis with elegant, consistent, single-color silhouette icons that match the website's overall color scheme.
*   **Domain Change**: Requested to change the domain to bitsecure.com (not implementable by the AI engineer).
